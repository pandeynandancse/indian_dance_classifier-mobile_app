## Overview
A mobile applcation that has been developed using java and Tensorflow to classify indian classical dance. Finetuned a pretrained MobileNet model to classify images.
Converted trained tensorflow model into tensorflow lite model and then deployed it on android appliaction. 

## Installation
a) Clone this project 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pandeynandancse/indian_dance_classifier-mobile_app.git
```

b) Open Android Studio <br>
c) Open folder from android studio <br>
d) Then turn gradle sync on and build project - This will install everything required in android studio . <br>
e) Now connect your mobile phone to android studio in developer model and allow file transfer. <br>
f) Click on run Icon in android studio which is placed in side of mobile name. This will install the project as an app into your mobile. <br>
g) Have a look at android apps and you will get an app named "indian_classical_dance_classifier" <br>
h) open it and start classifying via selecting MobileNet model from dropdown.<br>
